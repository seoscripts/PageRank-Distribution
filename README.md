PageRank-Distribution
=====================

This script will check the PageRank distribution of specified URLs and graph it. You can check the PageRank of the Root Domain of each URL or of the actual URL. You can also specify how many seconds you want the script to wait between queries (don't want to piss Google off).

Just download and put on your webserver. Enjoy!!
